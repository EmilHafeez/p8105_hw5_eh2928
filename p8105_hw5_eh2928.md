\#Problem 1

First things first, read in the data, and describe it.

``` r
homicide_df = 
    read.csv("./data/homicide/homicide.csv")

homicide_df %>% summary()
```

This raw dataset consists of 52179 rows and 12 columns. Data are
structured around individual-level homicide cases including an id
number, and then details location, arrest/resolution information, and,
often, demographic information regarding each victim. Several variables
are not of a tidied data type (e.g. not a factor, or numeric, or date
variable when this is prudent), and there is also missing data.

Total number of homicides in each city, and the number of unsolved
homicides.

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    homicide_total = n(),
    homicide_unresolved = sum(resolved == "unresolved")
  ) %>% arrange(desc(homicide_total))
aggregate_df
```
